                    Air pressure, temperature, mountain ranges, ocean currents and many other factors combine to
                    produce an enormous quantity of interacting variables all of which can alter the weather to a
                    greater or lesser extent. However, greater understanding of the science, plus the use of
                    powerful computer models, continue to improve our ability to make more accurate predictions with
                    longer lead times.

                    <p> Observations from various instruments are crucial to understand how the atmosphere, oceans,
                        rivers and lakes, land surface as well as the biosphere influence our weather, climate and
                        hydrology. Powerful computers in global centres process these quality-controlled data from
                        instruments and Earth-observing satellites to be used in numerical models based on physical laws
                        to produce weather, climate and water-related forecasts, predictions, and information products
                        and services for use in daily lives, long-term decision-making and research. Without these
                        valuable inputs from observations, the quality of the models is compromised.</p>

                    <p> Another important aspect is the quality of the numerical models themselves. Due to the
                        complexity of the processes governing weather, climate and hydrology, some approximations have
                        to be made in the computer models. Model developer work continuously on improving the accuracy
                        of numerical models, while also lessening the number of assumptions that have to be made.
                        Advancing the accuracy of the models also requires collaboration with computer scientists to tap
                        the progress being achieved in super computing. Since the first weather forecasts of the 1950s,
                        advancements in numerical weather prediction, and more recently in climate projections, have
                        gone hand-in-hand with progress in scientific computing capabilities.</p>

                    In science, the forecasting means the process of estimation of the value of some
                    variable at some future time. One of the primary functions of the national Weather
                    services is forecast of weather parameters such as rainfall, temperature, wind,
                    humidity etc. over a region averaged over a particular time period. For example
                    forecast of daily rainfall (rainfall averaged over a day).
